# 8. Slack

Slack makes team communication easier especially by making communication between
apps very smooth and integrated. 

It also makes the amount of information limited to the strict minimum smoothly.

Finally it also makes machine to human communication smooth and sexy.

## Integrations
- Envoy (for reception)
- Github
- Foursquare *try `/foursquare **business lunch** in **new york**`*
- Giffy
- Dropbox
- Have a look at [all the integrations](https://slack.com/apps)


## Create an account

## Create a Slack team chat

## Create two channels
- first-project channel

- discussion channel

## Communicate with other humans
- Pretty much similar to markdown
 - Use SHIFT+ENTER to create a new line
- Use \*text\* to write text in **bold**
- Use \_text\_ to write text in *italic*
- Use \~text\~ to write text in ~strikethrough~
- Use \> to indent a line in a block quote
- Use \>>> to indent a block of text in a block quote
- Use \`limit = 3 + age\` to format your text in code
- Have a look [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202288908-Formatting-your-messages) for more
- Definitely have a look at formatting code once you really get into a Slack team [here](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/204145658-Creating-a-Snippet)
