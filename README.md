## Personal note
All this stuff is not easy and more than half of it is quite advanced.
This is not about coding hardcore useless code, it's about learning 
as many different technologies and tools as possible by doing things.
If you follow all the steps, you will end up with an advanced project that 
you can easily inspire for your own other projects. Good luck ! :smile:
