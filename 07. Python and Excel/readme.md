# 7. Python and Excel

![Excel][excel_image]

## Aim
Process an excel file with Python, fetch some real web data and write computations back to it

## Excel spreadsheets :sparkle:
- We now have some Excel spreadsheets, saved in the default **.xlsx** format
- **transactions.xlsx** is a record of all the client transactions since the beginning of the year
    - It was generated by the *generate_excel.py* but you don't need to know that :smirk:
- **costs_and_prices.xlsx** indicate the following information:
    - The cost of an item
        - It is the cost to manufacture and ship the item
        - It is in *CNY* :yen: because our products are all made in China :blush:
    - The price of an item is the price at which it is sold to the client (with 15% tax :weary:)
        - So we need to deduce these 15% we have to pay to the state from our gains
        - These are in *EUR* :euro: because we ship to European countries
    - The fixed costs
        - This indicates the costs of the warehouse, the web server etc. per week
        - This one is in *GBP* :pound: because the company is actually based in UK :gb:
    - Note that our final revenues or profits are in *GBP*
    - **Assume** we exchange these currencies at each transaction automatically
    
## What the shop wants from us :convenience_store:
1. Write the overall sales of all transactions in *EUR* to *transactions.xlsx*
2. Display in Python a sorted list of the customers spending the most in a descending order
3. Calculate the variable profit in *GBP* of each transaction, taking into account:
    - Cost of an item and the GBPCNY exchange rate at the date and time of transaction, UK timezone
    - Price of an item and the past EURGBP exchange rate at the date and time of transaction, UK timezone
    - **DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT** the *fixed costs*
    - Write the results in an extra column in *transactions.xlsx*
4. Write to *transactions.xlsx* the overall profit in GBP since the beginning of the year
    - Take the fixed costs into account
    - Use the column previously created in 3
5. Optional: Provide a sorted list of the best selling week days (i.e Monday) in a descending order

## Spring cleaning of our Python
- We are going to reuse what we have done previously
- In *mycode.py* just remove:
    - The main code from line **22** to line **34**
    - Any `print` statements you may have at the end (without being in a function)
- Rename *mycode.py* to *calculations.py*
- Create a new Python file *excel.py*, open it in *Liclipse* and add the following content and **SAVE**:
```python
from calculations import Transaction, find_total_sales
# The line above uses the find_total_sales function we have wrote previously

def read_transactions(worksheet):   
    legend = worksheet['1']
    #["Date", "Time", "Client", "Trees bought", "Gnomes bought", "Chocolates bought", "Balls bought"]
    transactions = []
    number_transactions = len(worksheet['A']) - 1 #-1 for legend
    for row in range(2, number_transactions):
        date = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 1)
        time = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 2)
        client = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 3)
        trees = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 4)
        gnomes = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 5)
        chocolates = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 6)
        balls = worksheet.cell(row = row, col = 7)
        transaction = Transaction(date, time, client, trees, gnomes, chocolates, balls)
        transactions.append(transaction)
    return transactions  
                
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # This is where the main code is ran if you run this file
    # we use that weird __name__ thingy so that you can IMPORT that file elsewhere
    workbook = load_workbook("transactions.xlsx")
    worksheet = workbook['Transactions']
    transactions = read_transactions(worksheet)
    print "First transaction: "+str(transactions[0])
    print "Last transaction: "+str(transactions[-1])
    
    # Adding something to the worksheet
    worksheet.cell(row = 1, col = 8, value = "Trolling Hard") # Writes at the end of the legend row
    workbook.save("transactions.xlsx") #You need to save back your changes
```
- It will show errors related to *load_workbook* but we're getting there...

## PIP Install Packages (*recursive acronym*)
1. Python does not *understand* **.xlsx** files yet, we need to add a package
2. It's dead simple.
    - [Google python xlsx][google_xlsx] and the first thing you see is **openpyxl**
    - Open a terminal, enter `pip install openpyxl`
    - At the top of **excel.py** just add and the SAVE:
    ```python
    from openpyxl import load_workbook
    ```
    - You can now use the *load_workbook* function to read an Excel file in Python !!
3. Let's not forget about *Vagrant*... 
    - Look at the *Vagrantfile* with your code editor (**TIP:** Enter `cat Vagrantfile`) and you should see that:
    ```shell
    cd /vagrant
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt  
    ```
    - First line changes your directory (`cd`) to the shared directory `/vagrant` :file_folder:
    - Second line tells **pip** to install what is asked for in the *requirements.txt* file
    - Open *requirements.txt*... **NOTHING ?** *Yes.* Because we did not need any packages yet.
    - Just add **openpyxl** to the first line of *requirements.txt*
    - Next time, use `vagrant up --provision` to install that package in Vagrant :wink:

## Tasks
### 1. Overall sales of all transactions in EUR
- Add the two following functions in **excel.py** and fill up *read_prices()*:
```python
def read_prices():
    prices = dict()
    # Open workbook costs_and_prices.xlsx and read prices cells from it
    # Get the name and the price of each item
    # Then store the name and value of the item with prices[name] = value
    return prices
    
def write_total_sales_EUR(worksheet, total_sales_EUR):
    N = len(worksheet['A']) #Number of transactions + legend
    worksheet.cell(row = 1, col = N+1, value = total_sales_EUR)
    # The following line formats the cell as the EUR currency number in Excel
    worksheet.cell(row = 1, col = N+1).number_format = '"EUR "#,##0.00'
```
- Then replace the `__name__ == "__main__":` block with:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    workbook = load_workbook("transactions.xlsx")
    worksheet = workbook['Transactions']
    transactions = read_transactions(worksheet)
    prices = read_prices()
    #Now we use find_total_sales that we wrote before
    total_sales_EUR = find_total_sales(transactions, prices)
    write_total_sales_EUR(worksheet, total_sales_EUR)
    workbook.save("transactions.xlsx") #overwrites the previous version
```

### 2. Sorted list of the customers spending the most
- Just comment out the three last lines of the main code of **excel.py**:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    workbook = load_workbook("transactions.xlsx")
    worksheet = workbook['Transactions']
    transactions = read_transactions(worksheet)
    prices = read_prices()
    """
    #Now we use find_total_sales that we wrote before
    total_sales_EUR = find_total_sales(transactions, prices)
    write_total_sales_EUR(worksheet, total_sales_EUR)
    workbook.save("transactions.xlsx") #overwrites the previous version
    """
```
- Add the following function in **calculations.py** (very similar to *find_client_max_spent*):
```python
def sort_clients_by_spending(transactions, prices):
	money_spent = dict() #Dictionary so you can have 3 clients or 300 it will still work
	for t in transactions:
		if t.client not in money_spent:
			money_spent[t.client] = 0 #initializes to 0 for a client not encountered before
		money_spent[t.client] += t.trees * prices["tree"] + t.gnomes * prices["gnome"] + \
								 t.chocolates * prices["chocolate"] + t.balls * prices["ball"]
	# You can't sort a dictionary unfortunately because its unordered
    # But you can sort a list which has indices and is ordered
    # Anyway, just google it it should only take one line to sort money_spent !
    # Here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/613183/sort-a-python-dictionary-by-value
    return sorted_money_spent # That's a list of 'tuples' like [('mike',256), ('John', 23), ...]
```
- Find out how to [sort a dictionary by value in Python](https://www.google.com/search?q=sort+a+dictionary+by+value+in+Python) and fill in that function
- In **excel.py**, add `, sort_clients_by_spending` on the `from calculations import` line
- In **excel.py**, add the following at the end of the main code:
```python
    sorted_money_spent = sort_clients_by_spending(transactions, prices)
    # We are only interested in the clients, not the amount they spent so:
    print "Clients ranking: ",
    for i in range(len(sorted_money_spent)):
        print sorted_money_spent[i][0] + ", ",
    print
```
